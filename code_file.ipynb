    "Suppose you are a business (e.g. a FinTech) handing out loans to private individuals. Understandibly - credit default models would be a very important part of your business in order to understand who you should be giving out loans to and who you should be rejecting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its most simple form, a credit default model can be thought of as a dual optimisation problem:\n",
    "1. **risk-mitigation:** you want to be sure that a small number of \"accepted\" credit card clients end up defaulting.\n",
    "2. **profit-maximisation:** you want to make as much money as possible from your accepted credit card clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of modelling, this can be simply boiled down to:\n",
    "1. **high precision** in predicting y=0 (non-default). In other words, if the model predicts a client will <u>not</u> default, then we want to be very sure this is the case.\n",
    "2. **large number of y=0 (non-default) predictions**. Why? More non-default predictions means more customers paying more fees."

    "In a [**previous project**](https://github.com/evgeni-g-georgiev/Bayesian-Credit-Card-Default-Model) we had employed a Bayesian Logistic Regression to predict whether credit card users are going to default or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "In **this project**, I build a simple XGBoost model to tackle the same problem (on the same dataset) to showcase the potential for superiority of decision tree based models in credit default prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't done so already, you can follow the above link to read the full model we previously implemented. Otherwise, here is a summary of the main results in our Bayesian model which will act as the threshold we are aiming to beat:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) we ended up with a threshold adjusted ***defensive*** model biased towards predicting y=1(default). This resulted in a trade-off between overall accuracy and precision in prediction 0s (non-default cases). \n",
    "2) the model had high precision in predicting y=0 (non-default cases). It was correct in 90% of instances.\n",
    "3) The trade-off was that due to the defensive nature of the model, it predicted only 423 non-default cases. In otherwords, over 95% of the test set population was rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we will show in this project is that even very simple decision tree models can out-perform fairly complex linear models. In particular, our XGBoost model will do a much better job at the \"profit-maximisation\" aspect of our problem, while maintaining performance in \"risk-mitigation\".**\n",
